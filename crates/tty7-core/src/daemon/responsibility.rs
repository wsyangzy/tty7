//! Making the daemon its own *responsible process* on macOS (#909).
//!
//! macOS attributes privacy decisions — Local Network, Camera, Microphone,
//! Location, Apple Events — to a process's responsible process, and that is
//! fixed when the process is spawned: it is inherited from whoever started it.
//! The daemon is started by the GUI, so it and every shell it forks answer to
//! that GUI. That holds only while the GUI lives. The daemon is built to outlive
//! it — an update relaunches the GUI and keeps the shells — and once the GUI
//! that launched it is gone, new panes are no longer attributed to tty7.app.
//! Local Network then falls back to judging each binary on its own, and a
//! Homebrew `node` or `python` gets `EHOSTUNREACH` on the LAN while `/usr/bin`
//! tools, which are exempt, keep working.
//!
//! The fix is to disclaim the inherited responsibility at startup. There is no
//! way to change it in a running process, so the daemon re-executes itself —
//! `posix_spawn` with `POSIX_SPAWN_SETEXEC`, which is `execve` with spawn
//! attributes: same pid, same descriptors, same session — with
//! `responsibility_spawnattrs_setdisclaim` set. The new image is then
//! responsible for itself, and it is tty7.app's own signed executable, so its
//! shells are attributed to tty7 however long it outlives any window.
//!
//! Doing it at the top of `run_daemon` covers every way a daemon image starts:
//! a fresh spawn from the GUI or `tty7-cli`, and the far side of a handoff,
//! which is how a daemon started by an older build gets repaired in place
//! without losing its panes. Shells forked *before* that keep the attribution
//! they were born with; only panes opened afterwards pick up the new one.
//!
//! `responsibility_*` is private SPI in libsystem (Chromium, LLDB and others
//! use it the same way), so both symbols are looked up at runtime. If either is
//! missing, or anything fails, the daemon carries on exactly as before.
